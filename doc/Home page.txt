Magicgrove is computer implementation of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering popular trading card game] written in C#. The goal of the project is to implement ai algorithms which can perform at the same level as a casual human player. A short term goal (version 2.0) is to implement most of the cards available in Urza's block and to add support for limited tournaments (sealed & draft). Currently there are more than 400 unique cards available. When compared to the [http://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/List_of_MTG_Engines similar projects] the game excels at:

 * superior user interface,
 * good 40 step lookahead ai with intelligent pruning algorithms,
 * massive sealed tournaments (up to 500 computer players),
 * save & load support, 
 * easy & quick installation,
 * active development,
 * robustness

=== Sealed tournament game mode ===
Every player is given a random pack of 90 cards from chosen sets (1x tournament pack, 3x booster pack), which he uses to build his deck. Multiple rounds are played on each tournament, the number of rounds depends on the number of players. On the start of every round, players are paired using the Swiss pairing system. Players get 3 points for win and 0 points for loss. The player with most points wins the tournament. In case of a tie game won percentage is compared.

=== Save & load support ===
Single matches & tournaments can be saved via the in game menu (alt-q). The games can later be loaded via the Load saved game option.

=== Improved Ai ===
Increased game simulation performance. Increased simulation length to 40 steps. Combat improvement.

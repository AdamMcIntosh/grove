Magicgrove is computer implementation of a
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering popular trading card game]
written in C#. The goal of the project is to implement ai algorithms which can
perform at the same level as a casual human player. Currently there are 550
unique cards available. When compared to
[http://www.slightlymagic.net/wiki/List_of_MTG_Engines similar projects] the
game excels at:

 * great user interface,
 * good 40-step lookahead ai with intelligent pruning algorithms,
 * sealed tournaments (up to 500 computer players),
 * draft tournaments,
 * save & load support,
 * easy & quick installation,
 * active development,
 * robustness.

to try to add some new cards. Check out the 'Adding cards tutorial' series:

=== Added booster draft tournament game mode ===

Players are seated randomly at the table. Each player is given 3 booster packs.
Every player opens their pack and choose one card from it, then passes the rest
of the pack to the player on his left. Once everyone has passed their packs,
pick up the next pack (located on your right), pick the best card for your deck
from that pack and put it in your pile, and again pass it to the neighbor on
your left. This process continues until all the cards from the pack have been
picked. Then each player opens his or her next pack, picks a card, and passes
the pack to the right (Packs go left, right, left.). Once you have 45 cards
in your pile, it is time to build your deck. Booster Draft rules allow you to
add as much basic land as you want to your deck, and require that the deck be at
least 40 cards.

=== Deck editor enchantments ===
Users can use lucene search syntax to search various card fields: name, text,
flavor, power, toughness and type.

=== Custom avatars ===
Each player is given a random avatar from media/avatars folder.

=== New sets & updates ===
Added new set Urza's legacy.
Added Phyrexian Colossus, Viashino runner, Citanul Flute to Urza's saga
Tweaked base card ratings in Urza's saga.

=== AI performance ===
In some situations AI took a very long time to consider its moves. Search tree
pruning and AI performance was improved to keep search time at tolerable
levels.

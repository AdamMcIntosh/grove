### Added booster draft tournament game mode

Players are seated randomly at the table. Each player is given 3 booster packs.
Every player opens their pack and choose one card from it, then passes the rest
of the pack to the player on his left. Once everyone has passed their packs,
pick up the next pack (located on your right), pick the best card for your deck
from that pack and put it in your pile, and again pass it to the neighbor on
your left. This process continues until all the cards from the pack have been
picked. Then each player opens his or her next pack, picks a card, and passes
the pack to the right (Packs go left, right, left.). Once you have 45 cards in
your pile, it is time to build your deck. Booster Draft rules allow you to add
as much basic land as you want to your deck, and require that the deck be at
least 40 cards.
